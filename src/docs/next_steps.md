### **Next Steps for Model Enhancement**

#### **1. Model Ensemble and Stacking**

Explore combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy:

- Create a stacked ensemble using H2O's best models
- Experiment with different model architectures in the ensemble
- Use cross-validation to prevent overfitting in the stacking process

#### **2. Feature Engineering Refinements**

Further enhance the feature set based on domain knowledge:

- Add team-specific features (pace, offensive rating, etc.)
- Include matchup-based features
- Consider home/away game impact
- Experiment with different rolling window sizes (3, 7, 10 games)

#### **3. Model Interpretability**

Improve understanding of model predictions:

- Generate SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
- Create partial dependence plots
- Analyze feature interactions
- Document key insights for each statistic

---

#### **4. Performance Optimization**

Improve model training and prediction efficiency:

- Implement parallel processing for model training
- Optimize feature computation pipeline
- Add caching for frequently accessed data
- Profile and optimize memory usage during training

#### **5. Model Deployment and API**

Prepare models for production use:

```python
# Example FastAPI endpoint structure
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class PlayerStats(BaseModel):
    player_name: str
    recent_games: list
    position: str
    # Add other relevant fields

@app.post("/predict/stats")
def predict_stats(stats: PlayerStats):
    # Load models
    # Process input features
    # Generate predictions
    return {
        "pts_prediction": pts_model.predict(features),
        "trb_prediction": trb_model.predict(features),
        "ast_prediction": ast_model.predict(features),
        "three_prediction": three_model.predict(features)
    }
```

---

#### **3. Address Data Quality Issues**

- Investigate potential outliers like the maximum points per game (`150.4`), which could skew results.
  
```python
# Identify outliers
outliers = data[data['PTS_per_game'] > 50]
print(outliers)

# Remove outliers if necessary
data = data[data['PTS_per_game'] <= 50]
```

---

#### **4. Try More Complex Models**

Random Forest is a great baseline model, but more complex models might capture nonlinear relationships better:

- **Gradient Boosting Models**: XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost.
- **Neural Networks**: Use TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models.

Example with XGBoost:

```python
from xgboost import XGBRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Train an XGBoost model
xgb = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=6, random_state=42)
xgb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred_xgb = xgb.predict(X_test)
mse_xgb = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_xgb)
print(f"XGBoost MSE: {mse_xgb}")
```

---

#### **5. Hyperparameter Tuning**

The current RandomizedSearchCV approach is effective but can be improved with more iterations or GridSearchCV for finer tuning.

Example with GridSearchCV:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2],
    'max_features': ['auto', 'sqrt']
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=rf, param_grid=param_grid, cv=3, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error', n_jobs=-1)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

best_params = grid_search.best_params_
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
print(f"Best Parameters: {best_params}")
```

---

#### **6. Evaluate Model Performance**

Use additional metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and $$ R^2 $$:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score

mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
print(f"RÂ² Score: {r2}")
```

---

### **7. Visualize Predictions**

Visualize how well your model predicts `PTS_per_game` compared to actual values.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred, alpha=0.5)
plt.plot([y_test.min(), y_test.max()], [y_test.min(), y_test.max()], color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel("Actual PTS_per_game")
plt.ylabel("Predicted PTS_per_game")
plt.title("Actual vs Predicted PTS_per_game")
plt.show()
```

---

### Final Recommendations

1. Focus on improving feature engineering and removing irrelevant/noisy features.
2. Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM for better performance.
3. Iterate on hyperparameter tuning and evaluate using multiple metrics (e.g., MAE and $$ R^2 $$).
4. Visualize results to gain insights into model performance and areas for improvement.
